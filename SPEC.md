# Backend API specification for the CrateDB guestbook demo application

## Content Type

### Requests
The API uses JSON for requests and responses. This means that all requests that contain a payload (`POST` and `PUT` requests) must have the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers set to `application/json`.

### Responses
All successful API calls return as content type `application/json`, except the `GET /image/<digest>` request.

```
HTTP/1.1 ...
Content-Length: ...
Content-Type: application/json
...
```
